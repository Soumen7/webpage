The 22nd of January, 2024 marked a historic day in the history of this nation. This day will reverberate in the hallowed chambers of our institutions for days to come. This day marked the undoing of the ethos of this country and revealed the true face of the electoral mandate. Our rulers delivered on their promises in earnest. The people voted and they got their auspicious wishes fulfilled. When most of the nation's majority where celebrating the homecoming of their deity, a sharp chill ran down the spine of this country. The silence was defeaning and the charade was over. No longer was there need to pretend. The ugly brazenness has been unmasked and the people stood, blind to the ramifications of the day. It is on these days that we must reread our history and learn from the mistakes of our brethren around the globe.
